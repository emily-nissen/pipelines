# Pipelines

## Bulk RNA-seq

Includes steps for pre-processing, differential expression analysis, and gene set enrichment.

## Single-cell RNA-seq (10x genomics)

Includes steps for pre-processing, quality control, data set integration, and identifying marker genes.

## Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing

Includes scripts for pre-processing and analysis of methylation data from the NuGEN Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq technology. If using a different technology these steps could differ.
